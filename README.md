# Scripta-Tauri

A desktop app hosting the Scripta compiler 
(real-time compilation of source text in MicroLaTeX, XMarkdow or L0
to HTML)

See https://scripta.io for the web app.

As soon as I can figure out how to sign .dmg files, 
I will post installers for x86 and Apple Silicon binaries
for MacOS.

Meanwhile, you can compile the app form source
using the https://tauri.app toolchain.  This 
works for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
