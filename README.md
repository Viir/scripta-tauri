# Scripta-Tauri

A desktop app hosting the Scripta compiler 
(real-time compilation of source text in MicroLaTeX, XMarkdow or L0
to HTML).

The latest release is [here (.zip file for Mac OS)](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/scripta-tauri/releases)

The Mac OS distribution is a fat binary (Intel and Apple Silicon). I'll cross-compile for Linux and Windows soon.

See https://scripta.io for the web app.
