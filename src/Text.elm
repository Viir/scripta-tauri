\\section{What is MicroLaTeX?}


MicroLaTeX is a variant of LaTeX with a frictionless workflow and no-setup, interactive, real-time editing.  It is not a replacement
for LaTeX and cannot use the vast LaTeX package ecosystem.
But for many kinds of documents â€” class notes, problem sets,
etc., it can be an excellent choice.  Consider \\link{this example https://scripta.io/s/jxxcarlson:wave-packets-dispersion} at
\\link{Scripta.io https://scripta.io}, the web version of this app.




\\section{Before you start}

MicroLaTeX is \\term{block-structured}, a feature
which makes error-handling robust. A block is normally
a contiguous sequence of non-empty lines with at least
one empty line above and below.  An ordinary
paragraph is a block, and so is the text

\\image{https://d.img.vision/scripta/653375022-image.png width:300}

which renders like this:

$$
\\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}
$$


Always use the above format for display math, with the
\\dollarSign{}\\dollarSign{} symbols on
lines of their own. Always
put blank lines above and below a block.

LaTeX environments, which are also blocks, work
pretty much as expected:

\\begin{theorem}
There are infinitely many primes
$p\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ 4$.
Isn't that nice?
\\end{theorem}

Here is the source code:

\\image{https://d.img.vision/scripta/2585504525-image.png width:300}


Note how the fragments `\\begin{theorem}` and `\\end{theorem}`
are placed as lines by themselves, just as \\dollarSign{}\\dollarSign{} was.  Again, there is at least one blank line above
a block and at least one below.

Blocks (environments) can be nested:


\\image{https://i.ibb.co/qYPk1rN/image.png width:300}

Here is the result:



\\begin{theorem}
There are infinitely many primes

\\begin{equation}
p\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ 4.
\\end{equation}

Isn't that nice?
\\end{theorem}


You can, of course, use double dollar signs:

\\image{https://i.ibb.co/92qWw8n/image.png width:360}

\\begin{theorem}
There are also infinitely many primes satisfying

$$
p\\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ 8.
$$

Very nice too!
\\end{theorem}






\\section{Basics}


Text-mode macros work in the usual way: \\term_{macros, text mode}
\\term_{italic} \\term_{bold} \\term_{bold-italic}

\\begin{indent}
\\italic{Italic text}, \\bold{bold text},
and \\bold{\\italic{bold-italic text}}.
\\end{indent}

|| code
\\italic{Italic text}, \\bold{bold text},
and \\bold{\\italic{bold-italic text}}.

You can use `\\emph` instead of `\\italic`.
The usual `\\textit` and `\\textbf` macros also work.

Math-mode macros are defined like this \\term_{macros, math mode}
\\vspace{10}

\\image{https://d.img.vision/scripta/3131867526-image.png width:300}

\\begin{mathmacros}
\\newcommand{\\bra}{\\langle}
\\newcommand{\\ket}{\\rangle}
\\newcommand{\\vpipe}{\\ |\\ }
\\newcommand{\\set}[1]{\\{#1\\}}
\\end{mathmacros}


Then you can say `$\\bra x \\vpipe y \\ket$` to obtain $\\bra x \\vpipe y \\ket$.



\\section{Links}

To link to a web page, follow this template:

|| code
 \\link{New York Times https://nytimes.com}

Here it is in use:

| indent
I usually read the \\link{New York Times https://nytimes.com} while
eating breakfast.  You can use \\bs{href} also.
\\term_{links} \\term_{href}

You can also use the standard \\bs{href}:

|| code
\\href{https://nytimes.com}{New York Times}

| indent
\\href{https://nytimes.com}{New York Times}


\\section{Images}


The basic form:

\\begin{code}
\\image{URL}
\\end{code}

where URL might be `http://image.gov.birds/cardinal.jpg`

Here is an example that follows the form:

\\image{https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/field/image/CardinalSnowtlparadisPixabayCrop.jpg?itok=iyp0zGMz}

To add a caption, use this model:

\\begin{code}
\\image{URL caption:THE CAPTION TEXT}
\\end{code}

\\image{https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/field/image/CardinalSnowtlparadisPixabayCrop.jpg?itok=iyp0zGMz caption:Cardinal in Winter}

If an image exists on the internet, you are all set.
If not, you can use an image hosting service like
\\link{imgbb.com https://imgbb.com/}.  It has both free
and paid tiers.

\\section{Code}

Inline code is written in Markdown style with backticks e.g.,

|| code
This is some code: `a = {foo: 1, bar: 2}`.

This text renders as:

| indent
This is some code: `a = {foo: 1, bar: 2}`.

Here is how to write block code:

\\image{https://i.ibb.co/tJkzFxk/image.png width:220}

It renders like this:

\\begin{code}
numbers = range(1,20)

for i in numbers:
  print(i, i**2)
\\end{code}



\\section{More on math mode}

For numbered equations, use the \\italic{equation} environment
\\term_{environment, equation}:


\\image{https://i.ibb.co/BBSC61g/image.png width:270}

It renders like this:


\\begin{equation}
\\label{improper-integral}
\\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} dx = 1
\\end{equation}





Note the use of \\bs{label}.  One refers to this text
via `\\eqref{improper-integral}`: rendered as
the active link \\eqref{improper-integral}.

For lists of
equations, used the \\italic{aligned} environment
\\term_{environment, aligned}:

\\image{https://i.ibb.co/nC80stz/image.png width:200}

It renders like this:

\\begin{aligned}
a &= x + y \\
b &= x - y \\
ab &= (x + y)(x - y) \\
&= x^2 - y^2
\\end{aligned}


\\section{Export}

MicroLaTeX documents can be exported
to standard LaTeX
ready to be run through `pdflatex`, or to PDF.  Use the
buttons in the toolbar on the right.

| section 1
What it is

L0 is a markup language with a Lisp-like syntax.  As an example,
if one says `[i italic text]`, one gets 
[i italic text], while `[i [b bold] [blue italic] text]` yields
[i [b bold] [blue italic] text].  

A construct like `[i italic text]` is called an [term L-expression].  It has the form left bracket followed by the name
of the L-expression followed by its arguments, followed by a right bracket.  The arguments are themselves L-expressions: ordinary text, or the kind of L-expression just described.
There are two special kinds of L-expressions: 

|| code
$ ... $

for in-line mathematics  and 

|| code
` ... `

for in-line code.  Thus `$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$` renders
as $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ and 

|| code
`a[i] := 0`

renders as `a[i] := 0`.


| subheading
Verbatim Blocks

In addition to L-expression, there are [term blocks].  The text


|| code

https://www.birdsandblooms.com...jpg


renders an online image:


|| image

The text 


|| code
$$
\\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}
$$

renders an equation:

$$
\\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}
$$


| subheading
Ordinary Blocks

For section headings, we say this:

|| code
| section 1
Introduction

The "1" means that this is a top-level section.  Thus we use
`| section 2` for subsections.  For theorems, we say this:

|| code
| theorem (Pythagoras)
If $a$ and $b$ are the legs of a right triangle and $c$
is the hypotenuse, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

| theorem (Pythagoras)
If $a$ and $b$ are the legs of a right triangle and $c$
is the hypotenuse, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

An ordinary block begins with `|` while a verbatim block 
begins with `||`.

\\section{Introduction}

As we have seen with the sinc packet, wave packets can be localized in space.  A key feature of such packets is their \\term{group velocity} $v_g$.



This is the velocity which which the "body" of the wave packet travels.  Now a wave packet is synthesized by superposing many plane waves, so the natural question is how is the group velocity of the packet related to the phase velocities of its constituent plane waves.  We will answer this first in the simplest possible situation -- a superposition of two sine waves.  Next, we will reconsider the case of the sinc packet.  Finally, we will study a more realistic approximation to actual wave packets which gives insight into the manner and speed with which wave packets change shape as they evolve in time.  We end by applying this to an electron in a thought experiment in which it has been momentarily confned to an atom-size box -- about one Angstrom, or
$10^{-10} \\text{ meter}$.



\\section{A two-frequency packet: beats!!!!}

\\image{https://psurl.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jc/beats-eca1.png width:300 caption: Two-frequency beats}

Consider a wave
$\\psi = \\psi_1 + \\psi_2$ which is the sum of two terms with slightly different frequencies.  If the waves are sound waves, then then what one will hear is a pitch that corresponding to the average of the two frequencies modulated in such a way that the volume goes up and down at a frequency corresponding to their difference.

Let us analyze this phenomenon mathematically, setting



\\begin{equation}
\\psi_1(x,t)  = \\cos((k - \\Delta k/2)x - (\\omega - \\Delta \\omega/2)t)
\\end{equation}

and

\\begin{equation}
\\psi_2(x,t)  = \\cos((k + \\Delta k/2)x - (\\omega + \\Delta \\omega/2)t)
\\end{equation}

By the addition law for the sine, this can be rewritten as

\\begin{equation}
\\psi(x,t) = 2\\sin(kx - \\omega t)\\sin((\\Delta k)x - (\\Delta \\omega)t)
\\end{equation}


The resultant wave -- the sum -- consists of of a high-frequency sine wave oscillating according to the average of the component wave numbers and angular frequencies, modulated by a cosine factor that oscillates according to the difference of the wave numbers and the angular frequencies, respectively.  The velocity associated to the high frequency factor is

\\begin{equation}
v_{phase} = \\frac{\\omega}{k},
\\end{equation}

whereas the velocity associated with the low-frequency factor is

\\begin{equation}
v_{group} = \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\Delta k}
\\end{equation}

This is the simplest situation in which one observes the phenomenon of the group velocity.  Take a look at this \\href{https://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109N/more_stuff/Applets/wavepacket/wavepacket.html}{animation}.


\\section{Step function approximation}

We will now find an an approximation to

\\begin{equation}
\\psi(x,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty a(k) e^{i(kx - \\omega(k)t)} dk
\\end{equation}

under the assumption that $a(k)$ is nearly constant over an interval from $k_0 -\\Delta k/2$ to $k_0 + \\Delta k/2$ and that outside of that interval it approaches zero at a rapid rate.  In that case the Fourier integral is approximated by

\\begin{equation}
\\int_{k_0 - \\Delta k/2}^{k_0 + \\Delta k/2}  a(k_0)e^{i((k_0 + (k - k_0)x - (\\omega_0t + \\omega_0'(k - k_0)t))}dk,
\\end{equation}

where $\\omega_0 = \\omega(k_0)$ and $\\omega_0' = \\omega'(k_0)$.
This integral can be written as a product $F(x,t)S(x,t)$, where the first factor is "fast" and the second is "slow."  The fast factor is just

\\begin{equation}
F(x,t) = a(k_0)e^{ i(k_0x - \\omega(k_0)t) }
\\end{equation}

It travels with velocity $v_{phase} = \\omega(k_0)/k_0$.  Setting $k; = k- k_0$, the slow factor is

\\begin{equation}
S(x,t) = \\int_{-\\Delta k/2}^{\\Delta k/2} e^{ik'\\left(x - \\omega'(k_0)t\\right)} dk',
\\end{equation}

The slow factor be evaluated explicitly:

\\begin{equation}
I = \\int_{-\\Delta k/2}^{\\Delta k/2} e^{ik'u} dk' = \\frac{1}{iu} e^{ik'u}\\Big\\vert_{k' = - \\Delta k/2}^{k' = +\\Delta k/2}.
\\end{equation}

We find that

\\begin{equation}
I = \\Delta k\\thinspace \\text{sinc}\\frac{\\Delta k}{2}u
\\end{equation}

where $\\text{sinc } x = (\\sin x )/x$.  Thus the slow factor is

\\begin{equation}
S(x,t) = \\Delta k\\, \\text{sinc}(  (\\Delta k/2)(x - \\omega'(k_0)t)  )
\\end{equation}


Putting this all together, we have

\\begin{equation}
\\psi(x,t) \\sim a(k_0)\\Delta k_0\\, e^{i(k_0x - \\omega(k_0)t)}\\text{sinc}(  (\\Delta k/2)(x - \\omega'(k_0)t)  )
\\end{equation}

Thus the body of the sinc packet moves steadily to the right at velocity $v_{group} = \\omega'(k_0)$


\\section{Gaussian approximation}

The approximation used in the preceding section is good enough to capture and explain the group velocity of a wave packet.  However, it is not enough to explain how wave packets change shape as they evolve with time.  To understand this phenomenon, we begin with  an arbitrary packet

\\begin{equation}
\\psi(x,t) = \\int_{\\infty}^\\infty a(k) e^{i\\phi(k)}\\,dk,
\\end{equation}

where $\\phi(k) = kx - \\omega(k)t$.  We shall assume that the spectrum $a(k)$ is has a maximum at $k = k_0$ and decays fairly rapidly away from the maximum.  Thus we assume that the Gaussian function

\\begin{equation}
a(k) = e^{ -(k-k_0)^2/ 4(\\Delta k)^2}
\\end{equation}

is a good approximation.  To analyze the Fourier integral

\\begin{equation}
\\psi(x,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ -(k-k_0)^2/ 4(\\Delta k)^2} e^{i(kx - \\omega(k) t)},
\\end{equation}

we expand $\\omega(k)$ in a Taylor series up to order two, so that

\\begin{equation}
\\phi(k) = k_0x + (k - k_0)x - \\omega_0t - \\frac{d\\omega}{dk}(k_0) t- \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{ d^2\\omega }{ dk^2 }(k_0)( k - k_0)^2 t
\\end{equation}

Writing $\\phi(k) = k_0x - \\omega_0t + \\phi_2(k,x,t)$, we find that

\\begin{equation}
\\psi(x,t) = e^{i(k_0x - \\omega_0 t)} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ -(k-k_0)^2/ 4(\\Delta k)^2} e^{i\\phi_2(k,x,t)}.
\\end{equation}

Make the change of variables $k - k_0 = 2\\Delta k u$, and write $\\phi_2(k,x,t) = Q(u,x,t)$, where $Q$ is a quadratic polynomial in $u$ of the form $au + b$. One finds that

\\begin{equation}
a = -(1 + 2i\\alpha t  (\\Delta k)^2),
\\end{equation}

where

\\begin{equation}
\\alpha = \\frac{ d^2\\omega }{ dk^2 }(k_0)
\\end{equation}

One also finds that

\\begin{equation}
b = 2i\\Delta k(x - v_g t),
\\end{equation}

where $v_g = d\\omega/dk$ is the group velocity.  The integral is a standard one, of the form

\\begin{equation}
\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{- au^2 + bu} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}\\; e^{ b^2/4a }.
\\end{equation}

Using this integral  formula and the reciprocity $\\Delta x\\Delta k = 1/2$, which we may take as a definition of $\\Delta x$, we find, after some algebra, that

\\begin{equation}
\\psi(x,t) \\sim A e^{-B} \\,e^{i(k_0 - \\omega_0t)}
,
\\end{equation}

where

\\begin{equation}
A = 2\\Delta k \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1 + 2i\\alpha \\Delta k^2 t}}
\\end{equation}

and

\\begin{equation}
B = \\frac{( x-v_gt )^2 (1 - 2i\\alpha \\Delta k^2 t)}{4\\sigma^2}
\\end{equation}

with

\\begin{equation}
\\sigma^2 = \\Delta x^2 + \\frac{\\alpha^2 t^2}{4 \\Delta x^2}
\\end{equation}

Look at the expression $B$. The first factor in the numerator controls the motion of motion of the packet and is what guides it to move with group velocity $v_g$.  The second factor is generally a small real term and a much larger imaginary one, and so only affects the phase.  The denominator controls the width of the packet, and as we can see, it increases with $t$ so long as $\\alpha$, the second derivative of $\\omega(k)$ at the center of the packet, is nonzero.

\\section{The electron!}

Let us apply what we have learned to an electron which has been confined to a box about the size of an atom, about $10^{-10}$ meters. That is, $\\Delta x \\sim 10^{-10}\\text{ m}$.  The extent of its wave packet will double when

\\begin{equation}
\\frac{\\alpha^2 t^2}{4 \\Delta x^2} \\sim \\Delta x^2,
\\end{equation}

that is, after a time

\\begin{equation}
t_{double} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{\\alpha}
\\end{equation}

The dispersion relation for a free particle is

\\begin{equation}
\\omega(k) = \\hbar \\frac{k^2}{2m},
\\end{equation}

so that $\\alpha = \\hbar/m$.  Then

\\begin{equation}
t_{double} \\sim \\frac{m}{h}\\, \\Delta x^2 .
\\end{equation}

In the case of our electron, we find that $t_{double} \\sim 10^{-16}\\,\\text{sec}$.
